## About
There are 4 papers in this Repo. Each paper was written as a homework assignment for UW AMATH.
### Filter White Noise
The goal of this paper is to isolate the frequency of an object that is moving and surrounded by noise. To do this we will average the signals in signal space (or frequency domain), and find the maximum to create a Gaussian filter. We then apply the filter to the signals in the time domain to isolate the signal of the object. We track the position of the object and report out it's final location.
### Gabor Transforms
The goal of this paper is to analyze music using Gabor Transforms or Short-Time Fourier Transforms. First we analyze a small portion of Handel's Messiah and look at its spectrogram using a few different filters. Then we look at a composure of Mary Had a Little Lamb on both a piano and recorder and compare the two pieces.
### Principal Component Analysis
The goal of this paper is to effectively use Principal Component Analysis in an experiment containing video data for numerous cases that is oversampled to understand the signals underneath. 
### Deep Learning: Music Classification
The goal of this paper is to perform Spectral Value Decomposition analysis on two  different types of data. The first type being facial images (either cropped or uncropped), and the second being music. After performing analysis on the music, we use Matlab's Classification Learner app to classify the music for three different tests.
